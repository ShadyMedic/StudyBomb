        <h1>Welcome to study bomb!</h1>
        <p>The logic behind this utility is simple.</p>
        <p>
            Do you have problems with your attention span? Do you feel the urge to make frequent study breaks while
            preparing for exams to check your phone, pets, children (lol)?
        </p>
        <p>
            Simply put a subtle pressure upon yourself to discourage your brain from stopping to read your study
            materials.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make an estimate how much time do you need to read one page of your textbook (or PDF document or anything
            really). Then set this time in the clock and set them running. Once you finish reading the page, press the
            button to add the same amount of time to the countdown again.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the time runs out, a randomly selected annoying song will play. This should stress you enough to make you
            want to avoid the countdown hitting zero.
